Introduction

Recommender system is an artificially designed system to mine users' interest based on historical data, helping decision making, booming sales and achieving better user experience. It is born to tackle information overload under current Big Data environment.

Back in old days, there are mainly two kinds of websites: web portals and search engine. 

A web portal is most often one specially-designed Web page at a website which brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way (definition coming from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal). For example, Yahoo, one of the leading members in this area, provides precisely classified information to every visitor. The problem with this type of website is that it is very hard to artifically position every information, for some of them may belong to various areas, while others may be hard to classify when evaluating from different views. Web editors' mind may not always match everybody's thought, which may annoy some users. Another problem with portals is that it can mainly list the most important and popular events and exclude many "trivial" information, making the diversity of information poor. 

A web search engine is a software system that is designed to search for information on the World Wide Web. Different from portals, the GUI of a web search engine, like Google, is quite neat, with only a textbox waiting for users' input. Its idea is to provide the most relevant information according to user needs, a kind of personalized service. However, the mainly shortage here is that users have to figure out what they really want and make rather precise description (usually in natural language) about desired information. In many cases, people could not make both conditions matched. For example, when surfing on a music fm, most people won't be able to give the exact list of music of their tastes and describe precisely the type of music they love. Thus we need to develop a system which can automatically do these things for users and provide personalized service. And this is where Recommender system origins.
