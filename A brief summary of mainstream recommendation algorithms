Introduction

Recommender system is an artificially designed system to mine users' interest based on historical data, helping decision making, booming sales and achieving better user experience. It is born to tackle information overload under current Big Data environment.

Back in old days, there are mainly two kinds of websites: web portals and search engine. A web portal is most often one specially-designed Web page at a website which brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way (definition coming from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal). For example, Yahoo, one of the leading member in this area, provides precisely classified information to every visitor. The problem with this type of website is that it is very hard to artifically position every information, for some of them may belong to various areas, while others may be hard to classify when evaluating from different views. Web editors' mind may not always match everybody's thought, which may annoy some users. Another problem with portals is that it can mainly list the most important and popular events and exclude many "trivial" information, making the diversity of information poor.
