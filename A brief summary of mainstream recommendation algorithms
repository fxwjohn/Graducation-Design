Introduction

Recommender system is an artificially designed system to mine users' interest based on historical data, helping decision making, booming sales and achieving better user experience. It is born to tackle information overload under current Big Data environment.

Back in old days, there are mainly two kinds of websites: web portals and search engine. 

A web portal is most often one specially-designed Web page at a website which brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way (definition from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal). For example, Yahoo, one of the leading members in this area, provides precisely classified information to every visitor. The problem with this type of website is that it is very hard to artifically position every information, for some of them may belong to various areas, while others may be hard to classify when evaluating from different views. Web editors' mind may not always match everybody's thought, which may annoy some users. Another problem with portals is that it can mainly list the most important and popular events and exclude many "trivial" information, making the diversity of information poor. 

A web search engine is a software system that is designed to search for information on the World Wide Web (defintions from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine). Different from portals, the GUI of a web search engine, like Google, is quite neat, with only a textbox waiting for users' input. Its idea is to provide the most relevant information according to user needs, a kind of personalized service. However, the mainly shortage here is that users have to figure out what they really want and make rather precise description (usually in natural language) about desired information. In many cases, people could not make both conditions matched. For example, when surfing on a music fm, most people won't be able to give the exact list of music of their tastes and describe precisely the type of music they love. Thus we need to develop a system which can automatically do these things for users and provide personalized service. And this is where Recommender system origins.

Since 1990s, Recommender system has been widely used in various web applications. Douban.fm, an online music radio, uses recommendation algorithms to decide next song based on users' historical likes and dislikes. Amazon, a large e-business company, will recommend new things similar to users' previous shopping records. Facebook, the most popular social website, uses common friends as the main feature to make friends recommendation, help enlarging users' friends circle. Hulu, a newly-risen company, makes Ad recommendations to users based on their tastes, bring the whole profit to a new level. With all these successful business applications, Recommender system has been playing an increasingly important role in current web environment.

During its application, Recommender System has confronted many real-life problems. The first one is called cold-start problem, where it is very hard to recommend things to newly-registered users, because system knows very little about their own information. Second is called explainability. It is not easy to give a reasonable explanation for each recommendation result, which may wonder users and make it less likely for them to accept. Last comes the scalability problem. Many algorithms produced in academic field are hard to be implemented in real systems, for their performance may suffer severely coping with data of Gigabytes. Other issues will not be included in the discussion here.
